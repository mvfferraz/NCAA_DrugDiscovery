# NCAA_DrugDiscovery
A repository focused on calculating atomic charges for non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) and modified residues using quantum chemistry methods. These charges are essential for accurate molecular modeling and drug discovery applications.

**Modern drug discovery often involves non-standard amino acids or modified residues, requiring precise atomic charges to model their behavior in molecular simulations accurately. This repository includes:
**

Quantum Chemistry Workflows: Preparing molecules, running calculations, and extracting charges.

Charge Fitting: Scripts to generate RESP or equivalent atomic charges.

File Conversion: Tools to adapt quantum results for molecular simulation packages like GROMACS, AMBER, and CHARMM.

Application Examples: Demonstrating the integration of NCAA charges into molecular simulations and docking studies.
